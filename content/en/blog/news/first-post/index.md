DaisyKit team is developing a high performance SDK for AI with a focus on the ease of deployment on different platforms. The idea is to develop an AI core library in C++ for the best performance, and examples to deploy AI systems easily on mobile (Android, iOS), embedded devices, web browsers and desktop PCs.

All contributions from community are welcome.
